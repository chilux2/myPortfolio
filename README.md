# myPortfolio

For one of my projects i was tasked with the aim of creating my very own portfolio website, I really enjoyed this task as i got to test myself by using most of the things id learned
it was the first project i got to use HTML5 , CSS and Java all together and I'm glad it worked out well. considering this was my first complete website i created all by myself , any feed back would be appreiciated 
thanks in advance 


Key points 
================
1. I managed to use Git to track my projects 
2. I built an about me page , project page , and a page for people to contact me 
3. I managed to plan my own website and drew how it would look on paper and execute it on a computer 
4. I managed to make it interactive using javascript , by having people click on buttons and video examples of my passed projects being shown 
5. I managed to make is accessible and viewable on any device, this was done by me using the developer tools and testing to make sure i got the right measurements
