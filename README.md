# myPortfolio

For one of my projects i was tasked with the aim of creating my very own portfolio website, I really enjoyed this task as i got to test myself by using most of the things id learned
it was the first project i got to use HTML5 , CSS and Java all together and I'm glad it worked out well. considering this was my first complete website i created all by myself , any feed back would be appreiciated 
thanks in advance
